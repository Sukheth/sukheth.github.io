title: Uses This

List of things I use. Inspired by [usesthis.com](https://usesthis.com)

### Hardware

- **Macbook Air M3**: My laptop. Best decision switching from my rusty old dell inspiron. The battery life is the greatest value add
- **Galaxy S23**: My phone. Great camera, bad battery life
- **iPad Pro 11"**: Bought this in college, was very useful then, not so much now. Now I mostly use it to consume content and use it as a second screen to my laptop sometimes
- **Sony WH-1000XM6**: Incredible noise cancelling headphones. Makes the many hours spent in public transport productive and great for locking-in. Battery life is also amazing
- **Soundcore v20i**: My earphones. Open-ear, hooks around my ear. Sounds very good for its form factor and complements my headphones well
- **Galaxy watch 7**: Works very well with my phone of course. Has been very helpful in tracking sleep and reducing screen time and missed calls
- **Logitech K380**: Cute keyboard. Not the best typing experience but lightweight and slim, easy to travel with
- **Logitech MX Master 3S**: Great mouse. Very comfortable to hold and the side-scroll + back-forward buttons have been boosters
- **Samsung S3 Monitor**: Had the 24 inch in college and seemed fine then so I got a 27 inch at home. But I regret it now. DPI is bad and takes a while to boot up when connected
- **ikea Relatera height-adjustable**: My work desk at home. I like it
- **Greensoul Zodiac Lite**: Used this in college, Great chair for it's price
- **Urbn Ultra Link 20000mAh**: Good power bank. In-built cable is a game-changer
- **Ambrane 10000 mAh Magsafe Power bank**: For daily use. I don't like ambrane so much, this was an impulse instamart purchase
- **Daily Objects Magsafe Case for S23**: Adds magsafe compatibility to my S23
- **ESR Case**: Alternative case for my phone
- **Daily Objects 45W GaN Charger**: Comes in very handy because it takes 2 USB-C cables while still charging at a sufficient pace. It has been heating up a lot lately however
- **Trove wallet**: Had always wanted to get this and finally got it a year ago. Very minimal and fairly convenient
- **Spigen iPad Case**: I like this one but it has a pencil stand, which is nice but adds a lot to it's bulkiness. While this has more protection, I would have gotten the magnetic one in hindsight
- **Daily Object Ambit Messenger Bag**: Got this one recently for daily work commute. I love this
- **North Face Borealis**: For the longer uses; overnight etc

### Software

#### Home Screen 

- **Youtube**: Self explanatory, half of my day goes here
- **Twitter**: The other half of my day
- **Youtube Music**: My go-to music app
- **Spotify**: I also use spotify on random occasions (almost everyday) because I like to keep comparing them always. Little weird I know
- **Maps**: maps
- **Pocketcasts**: The podcast app I use when I want to do audio only
- **Google keep**: For quick captures
- **Reader**: My RSS aggregator. I can't live without this. My 3rd half of the day
- **Obsidian**: My note taking app. Moved from notion recently. Great decision
- **Gmail**: for email
- **Camera**: camera
- **Whatsapp**: for the gossips
- **Phone**: when I don't call on whatsapp
- **Adobe Scan**: for photo based scans
- **Base**: my main crypto wallet
- **Bitwarden**: my password manager. It's open source, works cross-platform really well
- **Blip**: This is an amazing file transfer app. Incredibly fast. Even apple-only users should should switch from airdrop to blip
- **Notion calendar**: this just has a nice interface
- **BeReal**: was (and still is a little) a very fun app to stay in touch with friends and have an easy low-friction way to record your daily life in some form. I am a little less active on this now, but still use every now and then
- **Authy**: my 2FA app. it supports multi-device, works very well for me
- **Claude**: my favourite digital assistant. I use claude code with my obsidian vault (through an agent skill) and this also does a great job at doing the grunt work at my job
- **Gemini**: my other assistant. the limits here are way more generous and 2.5 pro is still very smart (3 is around the corner so it's only getting better) and it also integrates deep into my google workspace. it also works with my google home mini!
- **ChatGPT**: i don't like GPT5, but i somehow find it's voice mode more natural than the others, so i keep going back to this, just for talking to it when i want to learn something by asking, especially during commute
- **Coin**: for my mutual fund investments, never leaving zerodha, i love it
- **Kite**: for equity holdings
- **Swiggy Crew**: this is a concierge app from swiggy. it takes soo much random work off my plate and they get the work done so well
- **Samsung health**: for sleep, and other health tracking (because samsung watch)
- **Swiggy, Instamart**: i like the zomato products better, but i like swiggy's loyalty programme better so i continue to use this
- **Super Money**: my UPI app. very clean interface, fast, also better cashbacks :)
- **Google Tasks**: my todo list app. have tried tick tick and todoist before but i find them too busy. this is fast, has a good widget, and pushes to my calendar very well. i don't need much else
- **Rapido**: my default for cab/auto bookings
