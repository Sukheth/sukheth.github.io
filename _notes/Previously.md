#### Entrepreneurs First (June 2025 - September 2025)

I was in the BA (Bangalore) Summer'25 cohort at [Entrepreneurs First](https://joinef.com). My joining date at BCG was delayed and I always knew I wanted to start-up at some point in life. So I decided to try my hand anyway. I did not end-up starting a company, but I figured out what I needed before I made my next shot.

I was a part of the annual student delegation from IIT Madras to various government institutions in Delhi.
